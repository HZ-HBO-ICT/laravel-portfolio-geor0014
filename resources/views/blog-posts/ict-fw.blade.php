                    <p >An outstanding analyst is the very prerequisite for the success of your data efforts. A solid background in statistics is what brings rigor to data-driven decision-making. A data analyst looks at industry data to answer business-relevant questions and delivers these answers to the relevant teams. Data analysts transform large data sets, form hypotheses, and communicate these to business decision-makers. So they need to demonstrate a strong sense of the processes taking place beyond the data.</p>
